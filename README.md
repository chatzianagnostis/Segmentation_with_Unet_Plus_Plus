# Segmentation with Unet++

This repository represents a segmentation project training and evaluation for unett++ models

## Installation
1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Instead of using the [Segmentation Models Pytorch](https://github.com/qubvel-org/segmentation_models.pytorch) repository, install [the forked version from this repository (which includes Focal Tversky Loss and Panoptic Quality metrics)](https://github.com/chatzianagnostis/segmentation_models.pytorch):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chatzianagnostis/segmentation_models.pytorch.git
    cd segmentation_models.pytorch
    pip install .


## Quick start
- Train a model
 
  To train a model, use:
  ```bash
  python train.py --config config.yaml
  
- Evaluate the model
 
  To evaluate the model, use:
  ```bash
  python test.py --config config.yaml

> config.yaml is for training and evaluation

## Configure data and model

### Dataset Format:
   
Dataset should have the following format:       

Ensure your dataset has the following structure:

>Ensure that images and their corresponding masks have identical filenames,                            
>with only the directory or extension differing to indicate whether the file is an image or a mask.    
                                                                                                       
>For example, if you have an image file named image1.png in the images directory,                      
>its corresponding mask should be named image1.png in the masks directory.


### Config.yaml

Modify the `config.yaml` file as needed:
- Paths: Specify the paths to your data and where to save models.
- Image Properties: Set image width and height (must be divisible by 32). Provide the values for reshape, not the actual width and height.
- Model Parameters: Configure model-specific parameters.
- Class Names: Ensure class-0 is the background.
- Augmentations: Define any data augmentations.

> We provide an example for `config.yaml`

Refer to the [Segmentation Models Pytorch documentation](https://smp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for possible values for the `MODE`, `ENCODER`, `ENCODER_WEIGHTS` and `ACTIVATION` parameters.

## Optimaze HyperParameters

This section describes the process for optimizing hyperparameters for your model using the Tversky loss function. Specifically, we will optimize the `alpha`, `beta`, and `gamma` parameters for the Tversky loss, as well as the learning rate for training.

### Tversky Loss Parameters Optimization

To find the best values for the `alpha`, `beta`, and `gamma` parameters in the Tversky loss function, run the following command:
   ```bash
   python train.py --config config.yaml --search_best_loss_params
   ```
Testing Area:
The following combinations of `alpha`, `beta`, and `gamma` will be tested:

- Alpha (α) and Beta (β):
1. α = 0.5, β = 0.5: Balanced emphasis on false positives and false negatives.
2. α = 0.7, β = 0.3: More emphasis on false negatives.
3. α = 0.3, β = 0.7: More emphasis on false positives.
4. α = 0.6, β = 0.4: Slightly more emphasis on false negatives.
5. α = 0.4, β = 0.6: Slightly more emphasis on false positives.
6. α = 0.8, β = 0.2: Strong emphasis on false negatives.
7. α = 0.2, β = 0.8: Strong emphasis on false positives.

- Gamma (γ):
1. γ = 1: This is equivalent to the standard Tversky loss. Start here as a baseline.
2. γ = 0.75: A slight reduction, making the loss a bit more forgiving for well-classified examples.
3. γ = 1.33: A moderate increase, putting more focus on misclassified examples.
4. γ = 1.5: Further increases the focus on hard examples.
5. γ = 2: A significant increase, heavily weighting misclassified examples.
6. γ = 2.5: An even stronger focus on hard examples.
7. γ = 3: Very strong emphasis on misclassified examples.
9. γ = 0.5: If you want to try a value less than 1, this significantly reduces the penalty for well-classified examples.

### Learning Rate

To find the best learning rate for training, run the following command:

   ```bash
   python train.py --config config.yaml --search_opt_lr
```
Testing Area:
The learning rate will be optimized within the range of `1e-5` to `1e-1` using a logarithmic uniform distribution:

> By systematically testing these values, we aim to find the optimal hyperparameters that minimize the Tversky loss and improve the model's performance.
